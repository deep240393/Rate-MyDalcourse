## [](#w3c-compliance-check)W3C Compliance Check

I only worked on the Event Details' component HTML. The header and footer are similar for all pages and are compliant. The Event Details's component HTML will throw errors on "*ngIf" ,"*ngFor", and service variables:{{eventdetails[0].firstname}} in terms of compliance. Any other HTML within the component is compliant. The css file is compliant.
